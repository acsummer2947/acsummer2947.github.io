    <p>Welcome! Thank you for visting my site. I will detail here effective skin care products, treatments and techniques for having healthy and youthful skin.</p>

    <p> Retinol and Retin-A<br>

Both are made from vitamin A and promote faster skin cell turnover. They're some of the most proven, effective and powerful options for treating skin issues ranging from acne to signs of aging. All three groups prevent the buildup of dead cells in the skin's pores and follicles and all three promote the growth of healthy cells.</p>

<p>Vitamin C<br>

Vitamin C helps to minimize fine lines, scars, and wrinkles. It's the only antioxidant that's proven to boost production of collagen, which is a key part of skin's structure.</p>

<p>AHA and BHA<br>
    AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids, e.g. glycolic and lactic acids) and BHA (beta hydroxy/salicylic acid) act to “unglue” the bonds holding dull, dead skin on the surface. Once those bonds are broken—gently and evenly—skin naturally sheds. So, although you won’t actually see your skin exfoliating, you’ll soon see the smoother, younger-looking skin hiding beneath.</p>

<p>Laser Treatments<br>
    If aging, acne, or too much time in the sun has left your face with blotches, scars, wrinkles, or lines, laser skin resurfacing may help your skin look younger and healthier. Laser skin resurfacing removes skin layer by layer with precision. The new skin cells that form during healing give the skin a tighter, younger looking surface. The procedure can be done alone or with other cosmetic surgeries on the face.</p>

<p>TCA Peels<br>
    TCA or Trichloroacetic Acid Peel help in enhancing the skin texture, tone and overall complexion. It helps eradicate large pores and shallow scars as well as helping remove blemishes, acne marks, dark spots, age spots, wrinkles and fine lines. It also helps reduce the effects of sun damage to make skin look way younger. It is the most widely used form of facial peel because it is very safe and highly effective. It may solve many skin problems and enhance to overall skin complexion. The use of TCA is not limited to the face, it can also be applied to other body parts such as the neck, back, legs, under arms, elbow and others.</p>
